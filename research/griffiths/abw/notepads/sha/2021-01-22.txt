Metal Gear Solid is super deep. Solid Snake just has so many characteristics that represent what it means to deal with psychological and personal struggles. 

Snake is a disillusioned stealth soldier genetically engineered to be the best fighter who suffers from existential and moral issues about the nature of war, tactics, politics, and life itself, really. Snake even denies the hero status, saying "I'm just a man who's good at what he does: killing." There are times in the games when he has to deal with betrayal (between friends and foes), deception (even forms of self-deception and fourth-wall-breaking like the game giving you a fake "Game Over" screen when you actually have to keep playing), and very subtle forms of gaslighting from various characters. These are all similar to how I've made sense of reality in light of the gaslighting in many contexts here and there.
